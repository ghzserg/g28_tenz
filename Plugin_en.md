### Installation Script

After calling `ENABLE_PLUGIN`, the file `install.sh` will be executed automatically.
After calling `DISABLE_PLUGIN`, the file `uninstall.sh` will be executed automatically.

### Single-language Plugin
Must contain the file:
```
g28_tenz.cfg
```
All functionality goes inside this file.

### Multi-language Plugin
Files are placed in language-specific subdirectories:
```
en/g28_tenz.cfg
ru/g28_tenz.cfg
de/g28_tenz.cfg
...
```

All output strings must be escaped, for example:
```gcode
RESPOND PREFIX="info" MSG="===Cutting the filament==="
```

---

#### Translation

Translations are stored in the `translate/` directory in files like `de.csv`:

```csv
Cutting the filament;Filament schneiden
```

Format:
```
English phrase;Translation in target language
```

To generate language files, run:
```bash
./Make.sh
```
The script will create the required directories and `.cfg` files.
