# Load cell parking
**Load cell parking** is a method to gently and precisely "park" the print head in a safe position **using sensors that measure force**.

Instead of simply stopping the head at the stop (as in a normal parking situation), the printer **slowly raises the table until it lightly touches the nozzle**, recording this touch by changing the load on the load cells. This allows you to:

- Precisely determine the true bed position,  
- Avoid Z-offset issues.
